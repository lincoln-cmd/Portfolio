'''
 utilize the data from the 'Gaia mission' to get sky positions, distances(parallaxes), proper motions, and radial
velocities for a set of stars that are close to the Sun. Then ransform these observes, heliocentric
kinematic measurements to Galactocentric Cartesian coordinates and employ the positions and velocities as initial conditions
to compute the orbits of these stars in the galaxy using the 'gala' Python package.
